# Bank Application 
This repository contains a basic simulation of a banking system implemented in Java. The project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as inheritance and encapsulation.

# Description

It includes validation checks and custom exceptions for various potential issues such as insufficient balance, invalid social security numbers, or withdrawal amounts.

<ol>
  <li>User: Represents a user or account holder with properties like first name and last name</li>
  <li>Account: Represents a bank account with operations like deposit and withdrawal.</li>
</ol>

## Custom exceptions used in this project are:

InsufficientAmountException: Thrown when the deposit or withdrawal amount is zero or negative.
